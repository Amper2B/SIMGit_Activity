echo Challenges Faced During This Activity:

echo Understanding SSH authentication and resolving connection issues.

echo Incorrectly setting the remote repository URL, which led to errors.

echo Working in the wrong directory (C:\Windows\System32), which caused permission issues.

echo Resolving authentication errors when using HTTPS and setting up credentials.

echo Figuring out how to correctly initialize and push the repository to GitHub.

echo Most Confusing Git Command:

echo git remote add origin ^<URL^>: It was confusing because an incorrect URL format caused errors.

echo git push -u origin main: Understanding the -u flag and how it sets upstream tracking.

echo ssh -T git@github.com: Connection timeout issues made SSH setup challenging.

echo How Version Control Helps in Real-World Software Development:

echo Collaboration: Allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.

echo Tracking Changes: Provides a history of changes, making it easier to debug and revert when needed.

echo Branching & Merging: Enables working on new features without disrupting the main project.

echo Backup & Recovery: Ensures code is safely stored and can be restored if needed.

echo Continuous Deployment: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
